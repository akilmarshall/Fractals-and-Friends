# Fractals and Friends
 A framework for my exploration and research of fractals and kindred self similar processes/structures. Written in python with heavy usage of [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about)

## Todo
I'm changing the orientation of the api for a "version 1". I was being very mathy in making the chaos games "functions" that operated on polygon "objects", this resulted in a kind of obtuse api that was easy to forget how to use.

In version 1 the chaos games are becoming the primary objects that users will interact with. The polygon objects will be hidden from the user and managed internally by the chaos game objects at the users behest.
